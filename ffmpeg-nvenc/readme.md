# Note

This is a straight rebuild from FFMPEG git source, using packaging from Ubuntu. This style of packaging is required for applications like Kodi. The Debian methods are not in line with what these packages require.

For now, a simple rebuild is used with the [Debian PPA method](https://wiki.debian.org/CreatePackageFromPPA)
