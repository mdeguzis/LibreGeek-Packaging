_Description: Rename "/etc/fpc.cfg" to "/etc/fpc.cfg.bak"?
 FPC now supports having multiple versions installed on the same system.
 The update-alternatives command can be used to set a default version for
  * fpc (the compiler);
  * fpc.cfg (the configuration file);
  * fp-utils (the helper tools).
 .
 Whatever version you may choose as default, the configuration files are
 always backward compatible, so it should always be safe to use the latest
 version.
 .
 In order to use the alternatives system on the system wide FPC configuration
 file you must accept renaming "/etc/fpc.cfg"; otherwise you will need to
 manage this manually by yourself.

_Description: Default MS Windows .rc resource compiler:
 FPC supports compiling programs that embed resources as MS Windows
 .rc-format files on all platforms where the MinGW windres tool is available.
 .
 In order to be able to compile projects using .rc files, you need first to
 manually install the package mingw32-binutils. mingw32-binutils is suggested
 by fp-compiler but not pulled in automatically.
 .
 If you want to enter a custom .rc file compiler that does not appear in this
 list or if you simply want to disable this feature, please select
 "Select manually".
