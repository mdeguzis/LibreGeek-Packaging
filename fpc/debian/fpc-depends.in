=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<fpc-depends> [S<I<debhelper options>>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

fpc-depends is a debhelper-like program that is responsible for
generating the ${fpc-abi:Depends} substitutions and adding them to
substvars files.

If you use this program, your package must build-depend on fp-utils
(>= 2.4.2-1).

foreach my $package (@{$dh{DOPACKAGES}}) {
  delsubstvar($package, "fpc-abi:Depends");
  addsubstvar($package, "fpc-abi:Depends", "fpc-abi-${VERSION}");
}
