 This C source file is part of the SoftFloat IEC/IEEE Floating-point Arithmetic
 Package, Release 2b.
 .
 Written by John R. Hauser.  This work was made possible in part by the

 of this code was written as part of a project to build a fixed-point vector
 processor in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley,
 overseen by Profs. Nelson Morgan and John Wawrzynek.  More information
 is available through the Web page `http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jhauser/
