  The "original" tarball is based on a git export, edited to leave out
  non-free tools, third-party libraries etc. as described by the
  get-orig-source target in debian/rules; you can use
  'make -f debian/rules get-orig-source' to repeat this process.
  .
  Some of the omitted libraries are DFSG-free themselves, but since we need
  to repack the tarball anyway, omitting them too means we don't need to
  comply with as many licenses.
  .
  The COPYING.txt files are not currently present in iortcw git.
  The versions in the orig.tar.gz were taken from the id Software
  code-drop, as made available by id Software on GitHub.

License: GPL-3+-with-idsoft-extra-terms
 There are two very similar license grants for code originating
 from the single-player or multiplayer engine, which are grouped
 together as one license for the purposes of this copyright file.
 The "additional terms" are among those allowed by the GPL version 3,
 section 7; they are the same as in the Doom 3 source code on which
 dhewm3 and rbdoom3bfg are based.
 .
 You can find the GPL license text on a Debian system under
 /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3.
 .
 ==== License grant ===================================================
 .
 [This is the single player version. The multiplayer version is
 identical, except for the replacement of "single player" and "SP"
 with "multiplayer" and "MP".]
 .
 This file is part of the Return to Castle Wolfenstein single player
 GPL Source Code (‘RTCW SP Source Code’).
 .
 RTCW SP Source Code is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

 Public License which accompanied the RTCW SP Source Code.  If not,
 please request a copy in writing from id Software at the address below.

 the RTCW SP Source Code is subject to the further restrictions below.
