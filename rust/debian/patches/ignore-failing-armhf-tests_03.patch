Description: Disable reference.md "Items_and_attributes_14" doctest, hanging on armhf
 This passes on i386 amd64 arm64

 for thread stacktrace during the hang; eddyb from #rustc suggests this might

 test again when we move to LLVM-3.8 (what Rust upstream is using) and if it
 still occurs then file a bug upstream.
