Comment: This package was mainly derivated (see readme.md)
 from triplesec (https://github.com/keybase/triplesec)
 that is itself derivated from crypto-js
 (https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/ now at
  https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/wikis/License.wiki).
 .
 crypto-js is distributed under BSD-3.
 .
 triplesec is distributed under expat
 (https://github.com/keybase/triplesec/blob/master/LICENSE)
 but only for its own modification due to cloning crypto-js.
 .
 ghash.js file is derivated see comment in the header from sjcl
 (https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/) that is distributed under
 BSD-2 or GPL-2 at your choice
 (see https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
 .
 This package is said upstream to be distributed under expat license
 but is really under BSD-3.
 .
 Jeff Mott is original author of crypto-js see

 .
 Maxwell Krohn is original author of triplesec releasing modification
 of cypto-js under expat license see
 https://github.com/keybase/triplesec/blob/master/LICENSE
 .
